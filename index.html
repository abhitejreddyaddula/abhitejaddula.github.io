    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a construction professional with a strong foundation in planning, scheduling,
      and project controls, complemented by a growing expertise in data analytics.
      My work sits at the intersection of the built environment and data-driven decision making.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through hands-on experience in construction projects, I have seen firsthand how
      delays, cost overruns, and risk often stem from limited visibility into data.
      This realization pushed me toward using analytics, dashboards, and emerging AI tools
      to transform raw project data into actionable insights.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am particularly interested in applying data analytics to construction planning,
      scheduling optimization, cost trends, productivity measurement, and risk forecasting.
      My long-term goal is to help project teams move from reactive reporting
      to proactive, predictive project delivery.
